    * take data out, look for values stored in it, checking size, and looking 
    * at the Nodes to see if they are all linked up correctly as a BST.
    *
    * The Tester class we give you as a suggested way to organize your tests 
    * and allow you to systematically build your ADT method by method, 
    * testing as you go, adding new tests as you add new code.

    * as I have done below.
